This is an Emacs module that invokes a command line program that requires an
a string of enumerations as input.  An example is the mnemonic option of the
[synconf](https://github.com/plandes/synconf) program.  The enumeration of
choices offered by the command line program are then read as a completing user
input in Emacs.


## Usage

You must create an instance of the `choice-prog` class and specify the program
with options.  For the [synconf](https://github.com/plandes/synconf) program
you'd add the following to your `~/.emacs` init file:
```lisp
(defvar synconf-the-instance
  (choice-prog nil
	       :program "synconf"
	       :interpreter "perl"
	       :buffer-name "*Synchronized Output*"
	       :choice-prompt "Mnemonic"
	       :choice-switch-name "-m"
	       :selection-args '("-a" "listmnemonics")
	       :documentation
"Run a synchronize command.  The command is issued with the `synconf'
perl script.")
  "The synconf object instance.")

(choice-prog-create-exec-function 'synconf-the-instance)
```

If you'd like add the configuration in another config file you can use add the
following:
```lisp
;;;###autoload
(defun synconf (&optional rest) (interactive))
(choice-prog-create-exec-function 'synconf-the-instance)
```

This adds the configuration file to autoloads (pattern matching on the
interactive function `synconf`).  Then the subsequent call to
`choice-prog-create-exec-function` clobbers the empty interactive definition
with that which invokes the command line program.
